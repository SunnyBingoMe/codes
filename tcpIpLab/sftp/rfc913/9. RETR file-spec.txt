     9. RETR file-spec

         Requests that the remote system send the specified file.

         Receiving a '-' from the server should abort the RETR command
         and the server will wait for another command.

         The reply from the remote system is:

             <number-of-bytes-that-will-be-sent> (as ascii digits)

            -File doesn't exist

         You then reply to the remote system with:

            SEND (ok, waiting for file)

               The file is then sent as a stream of exactly the number
               of 8-bit bytes specified.  When all bytes are received
               control passes back to you (the remote system is waiting
               for the next command).  If you don't receive a byte
               within a reasonable amount of time you should abort the
               file transfer by closing the connection.

            STOP (You don't have enough space to store file)

               Replies could be:

                  +ok, RETR aborted

         You are then ready to send another command to the remote host.
