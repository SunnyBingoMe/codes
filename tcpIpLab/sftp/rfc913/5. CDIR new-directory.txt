         This will change the current working directory on the remote
         host to the argument passed.

         Replies are:

            !Changed working dir to <new-directory>

            -Can't connect to directory because: (reason)

            +directory ok, send account/password

         If the server replies with '+' you should then send an ACCT or
         PASS command.  The server will wait for ACCT or PASS commands
         until it returns a '-' or '!' response.

            Replies to ACCT could be:

               !Changed working dir to <new-directory>

               +account ok, send password

               -invalid account

            Replies to PASS could be:

               !Changed working dir to <new-directory>

               +password ok, send account

               -invalid password
