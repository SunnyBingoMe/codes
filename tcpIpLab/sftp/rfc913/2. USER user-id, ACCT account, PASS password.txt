      USER user-id

         Your userid on the remote system.

         The reply to this command will be one of:

            !<user-id> logged in

               Meaning you don't need an account or password or you
               specified a user-id not needing them.

            +User-id valid, send account and password

            -Invalid user-id, try again

         If the remote system does not have user-id's then you should
         send an identification such as your personal name or host name
         as the argument, and the remote system would reply with '+'.
