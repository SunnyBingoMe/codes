            -Can't find <old-file-spec>

               NAME command is aborted, don't send TOBE.

         If you receive a '+' you then send:

            TOBE new-file-spec

         The server replies with:

            +<old-file-spec> renamed to <new-file-spec>

            -File wasn't renamed because (reason)
