<h2 class="sect1title">5. <a name="fifos">FIFOs</a></h2><hr class="mainsecthr"/>


<p>A FIFO ("First In, First Out", pronounced "Fy-Foh") is sometimes
known as a <i>named pipe</i>.  That is, it's like a <a href="pipes.html">pipe</a>, except that it has a name!  In this case, the
name is that of a file that multiple processes can <b><tt class="func">open()</tt></b>
and read and write to.</p>

<p>This latter aspect of FIFOs is designed to let them get around one of
the shortcomings of normal pipes: you can't grab one end of a normal
pipe that was created by an unrelated process.  See, if I run two
individual copies of a program, they can both call <b><tt class="func">pipe()</tt></b>
all they want and still not be able to speak to one another.  (This is
because you must <b><tt class="func">pipe()</tt></b>, then <b><tt class="func">fork()</tt></b> to get a
child process that can communicate to the parent via the pipe.)  With
FIFOs, though, each unrelated process can simply <b><tt class="func">open()</tt></b> the
pipe and transfer data through it.</p>




<h3 class="sect2title">5.1. <a name="fifonew">A New FIFO is Born</a></h3>


<p>Since the FIFO is actually a file on disk, you have to do some
fancy-schmancy stuff to create it.  It's not that hard.  You just have
to call <b><tt class="func">mknod()</tt></b> with the proper arguments.  Here is a
<b><tt class="func">mknod()</tt></b> call that creates a FIFO:</p>

<pre class="code">mknod("myfifo", S_IFIFO | 0644 , 0);</pre>


<p>In the above example, the FIFO file will be called
"<i><tt class="var">myfifo</tt></i>".  The second argument is the creation mode, which
is used to tell <b><tt class="func">mknod()</tt></b> to make a FIFO (the
<tt class="const">S_IFIFO</tt> part of the OR) and sets access permissions to
that file (octal 644, or <tt class="tt">rw-r--r--</tt>) which can also be set by
ORing together macros from <i><tt class="var">sys/stat.h</tt></i>.  This permission is
just like the one you'd set using the <b class="com">chmod</b> command.
Finally, a device number is passed.  This is ignored when creating a
FIFO, so you can put anything you want in there.</p>

<p>(An aside: a FIFO can also be created from the command line using the
Unix <b class="com">mknod</b> command.)</p>





<h3 class="sect2title">5.2. <a name="fifopc">Producers and Consumers</a></h3>


<p>Once the FIFO has been created, a process can start up and open it
for reading or writing using the standard <b><tt class="func">open()</tt></b> system
call.</p>

<p>Since the process is easier to understand once you get some code in
your belly, I'll present here two programs which will send data through
a FIFO.  One is <i><tt class="var">speak.c</tt></i> which sends data through the FIFO,
and the other is called <i><tt class="var">tick.c</tt></i>, as it sucks data out of the
FIFO.</p>

<p>Here is <i><tt class="var"><a href="http://beej.us/guide/bgipc/examples/speak.c" target="_blank">speak.c</a></tt></i>:</p>

<pre class="code">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;errno.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

#define FIFO_NAME "american_maid"

int main(void)
{
    char s[300];
    int num, fd;

    mknod(FIFO_NAME, S_IFIFO | 0666, 0);

    printf("waiting for readers...\n");
    fd = open(FIFO_NAME, O_WRONLY);
    printf("got a reader--type some stuff\n");

    while (gets(s), !feof(stdin)) {
        if ((num = write(fd, s, strlen(s))) == -1)
            perror("write");
        else
            printf("speak: wrote %d bytes\n", num);
    }

    return 0;
}</pre>


<p>What <b class="com">speak</b> does is create the FIFO, then try to
<b><tt class="func">open()</tt></b> it.  Now, what will happen is that the
<b><tt class="func">open()</tt></b> call will <i>block</i> until some other process
opens the other end of the pipe for reading.  (There is a way around
thisâ€”see <a href="fifos.html#fifondelay"><tt class="const">O_NDELAY</tt></a>,
below.)  That process is <i><tt class="var"><a href="http://beej.us/guide/bgipc/examples/tick.c" target="_blank">tick.c</a></tt></i>, shown here:</p>

<pre class="code">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;errno.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

#define FIFO_NAME "american_maid"

int main(void)
{
    char s[300];
    int num, fd;

    mknod(FIFO_NAME, S_IFIFO | 0666, 0);

    printf("waiting for writers...\n");
    fd = open(FIFO_NAME, O_RDONLY);
    printf("got a writer\n");

    do {
        if ((num = read(fd, s, 300)) == -1)
            perror("read");
        else {
            s[num] = '\0';
            printf("tick: read %d bytes: \"%s\"\n", num, s);
        }
    } while (num &gt; 0);

    return 0;
}</pre>


<p> Like <i><tt class="var">speak.c</tt></i>, <b class="com">tick</b> will block on the
<b><tt class="func">open()</tt></b> if there is no one writing to the FIFO.  As soon as
someone opens the FIFO for writing, <b class="com">tick</b> will spring to
life.</p>

<p>Try it!  Start <b class="com">speak</b> and it will block until you start
<b class="com">tick</b> in another window.  (Conversely, if you start
<b class="com">tick</b>, it will block until you start <b class="com">speak</b> in
another window.)  Type away in the <b class="com">speak</b> window and
<b class="com">tick</b> will suck it all up.</p>

<p>Now, break out of <b class="com">speak</b>.  Notice what happens: the
<b><tt class="func">read()</tt></b> in <b class="com">tick</b> returns 0, signifying EOF.  In
this way, the reader can tell when all writers have closed their
connection to the FIFO.  "What?" you ask "There can be multiple writers
to the same pipe?"  Sure!  That can be very useful, you know.  Perhaps
I'll show you later in the document how this can be exploited.</p>

<p>But for now, lets finish this topic by seeing what happens when you
break out of <b class="com">tick</b> while <b class="com">speak</b> is running.
"Broken Pipe"!  What does this mean?  Well, what has happened is that
when all readers for a FIFO close and the writer is still open, the
writer will receiver the signal SIGPIPE the next time it tries to
<b><tt class="func">write()</tt></b>.  The default signal handler for this signal prints
"Broken Pipe" and exits.  Of course, you can handle this more gracefully
by catching SIGPIPE through the <b><tt class="func">signal()</tt></b> call.</p>

<p>Finally, what happens if you have multiple readers?  Well, strange
things happen.  Sometimes one of the readers get everything.  Sometimes
it alternates between readers.  Why do you want to have multiple
readers, anyway?</p>





<h3 class="sect2title">5.3. <a name="fifondelay"><tt class="const">O_NDELAY</tt>!  I'm UNSTOPPABLE!</a></h3>


<p>Earlier, I mentioned that you could get around the blocking
<b><tt class="func">open()</tt></b> call if there was no corresponding reader or writer.
The way to do this is to call <b><tt class="func">open()</tt></b> with the
<tt class="const">O_NDELAY</tt> flag set in the mode argument:</p>

<pre class="code">fd = open(FIFO_NAME, O_RDONLY | <b>O_NDELAY</b>);</pre>


<p>This will cause <b><tt class="func">open()</tt></b> to return <tt class="const">-1</tt> if
there are no processes that have the file open for reading.</p>

<p>Likewise, you can open the reader process using the
<tt class="const">O_NDELAY</tt> flag, but this has a different effect: all
attempts to <b><tt class="func">read()</tt></b> from the pipe will simply return
<tt class="const">0</tt> bytes read if there is no data in the pipe.  (That is,
the <b><tt class="func">read()</tt></b> will no longer block until there is some data in
the pipe.)  Note that you can no longer tell if <b><tt class="func">read()</tt></b> is
returning <tt class="const">0</tt> because there is no data in the pipe, or
because the writer has exited.  This is the price of power, but my
suggestion is to try to stick with blocking whenever possible.</p>







<h3 class="sect2title">5.4. <a name="fifoconc">Concluding Notes</a></h3>


<p>Having the name of the pipe right there on disk sure makes it easier,
doesn't it?  Unrelated processes can communicate via pipes!  (This is an
ability you will find yourself wishing for if you use normal pipes for
too long.)  Still, though, the functionality of pipes might not be quite
what you need for your applications.  <a href="mq.html">Message
queues</a> might be more your speed, if your system supports
them.</p>
