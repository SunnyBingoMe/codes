<p>You know what's easy?  <b><tt class="func">fork()</tt></b> is easy.  You can fork off
new processes all day and have them deal with individual chunks of a
problem in parallel.  Of course, its easiest if the processes don't have
to communicate with one another while they're running and can just sit
there doing their own thing.</p>

<p>However, when you start <b><tt class="func">fork()</tt></b>'ing processes, you
immediately start to think of the neat multi-user things you could do if
the processes could talk to each other easily.  So you try making a
global array and then <b><tt class="func">fork()</tt></b>'ing to see if it is shared.
(That is, see if both the child and parent process use the same array.)
Soon, of course, you find that the child process has its own copy of the
array and the parent is oblivious to whatever changes the child makes to
it.</p>

<p>How do you get these guys to talk to one another, share data
structures, and be generally amicable?  This document discusses several
methods of <i>Interprocess Communication</i> (IPC) that can
accomplish this, some of which are better suited to certain tasks than
others.</p>






<h3 class="sect2title">1.1. <a name="audience">Audience</a></h3>


<p>If you know C or C++ and are pretty good using a Unix environment (or
other POSIXey environment that supports these system calls) these
documents are for you.  If you aren't that good, well, don't sweat
itâ€”you'll be able to figure it out.  I make the assumption,
however, that you have a fair smattering of C programming
experience.</p>

<p>As with <a href="http://beej.us/guide/bgnet/" target="_blank">Beej's Guide to Network Programming
Using Internet Sockets</a>, these documents are meant to springboard
the aforementioned user into the realm of IPC by delivering a concise
overview of various IPC techniques.  This is not the definitive set of
documents that cover this subject, by any means.  Like I said, it is
designed to simply give you a foothold in this, the exciting world of
IPC.</p>








<h3 class="sect2title">1.2. <a name="platform">Platform and Compiler</a></h3>


<p>The examples in this document were compiled under Linux using
<b class="com">gcc</b>.  They should compile anywhere a good Unix compiler is
available.</p>

<h3 class="sect2title">1.4. <a name="emailpolicy">Email Policy</a></h3>


<p>I'm generally available to help out with email questions so feel free to write in, but I can't guarantee a
response.  I lead a pretty busy life and there are times when I just
can't answer a question you have.  When that's the case, I usually just
delete the message.  It's nothing personal; I just won't ever have the
time to give the detailed answer you require.</p>

<p>As a rule, the more complex the question, the less likely I am to
respond.  If you can narrow down your question before mailing it and be
sure to include any pertinent information (like platform, compiler,
error messages you're getting, and anything else you think might help me
troubleshoot), you're much more likely to get a response.  For more
pointers, read ESR's document, <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html" target="_blank">How To Ask
Questions The Smart Way</a>.</p>

<p>If you don't get a response, hack on it some more, try to find the
answer, and if it's still elusive, then write me again with the
information you've found and hopefully it will be enough for me to help
out.</p>

<p>Now that I've badgered you about how to write and not write me, I'd
just like to let you know that I <i>fully</i> appreciate all the
praise the guide has received over the years.  It's a real morale boost,
and it gladdens me to hear that it is being used for good! <tt>:-)</tt>
Thank you!</p>
