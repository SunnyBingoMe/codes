<h2 class="sect1title">9. <a name="shm">Shared Memory Segments</a></h2><hr class="mainsecthr"/>


<p>The cool thing about shared memory segments is that they are what
they sound like: a segment of memory that is shared between processes.
I mean, think of the potential of this!  You could allocate a block a
player information for a multi-player game and have each process access
it at will!  Fun, fun, fun.</p>

<p>There are, as usual, more gotchas to watch out for, but it's all
pretty easy in the long run.  See, you just connect to the shared memory
segment, and get a pointer to the memory.  You can read and write to
this pointer and all changes you make will be visible to everyone else
connected to the segment.  There is nothing simpler.  Well, there is,
actually, but I was just trying to make you more comfortable.</p>



<h3 class="sect2title">9.1. <a name="shmcreat">Creating the segment and connecting</a></h3>


<p>Similarly to other forms of System V IPC, a shared memory segment is
created and connected to via the <b><tt class="func">shmget()</tt></b> call:</p>

<pre class="code">int shmget(key_t <i><tt class="var em1">key</tt></i>, size_t <i><tt class="var em1">size</tt></i>,
           int <i><tt class="var em1">shmflg</tt></i>);</pre>


<p>Upon successful completion, <b><tt class="func">shmget()</tt></b> returns an
identifier for the shared memory segment.  The <i><tt class="var">key</tt></i>
argument should be created the same was as shown in the <a href="mq.html#mqftok">Message Queues</a> document, using <b><tt class="func">ftok()</tt></b>.
The next argument, <i><tt class="var">size</tt></i>, is the size in bytes of the
shared memory segment.  Finally, the <i><tt class="var">shmflg</tt></i> should be set
to the permissions of the segment bitwise-ORd with
<tt class="const">IPC_CREAT</tt> if you want to create the segment, but can be
<tt class="const">0</tt> otherwise.  (It doesn't hurt to specify
<tt class="const">IPC_CREAT</tt> every time—it will simply connect you if
the segment already exists.)</p>

<p>Here's an example call that creates a 1K segment with <tt class="tt">644</tt>
permissions (<tt class="tt">rw-r--r--</tt>):</p>

<pre class="code">key_t key;
int shmid;

key = ftok("/home/beej/somefile3", 'R');
shmid = shmget(key, 1024, 0644 | IPC_CREAT);</pre>


<p>But how do you get a pointer to that data from the <i><tt class="var">shmid</tt></i>
handle?  The answer is in the call <b><tt class="func">shmat()</tt></b>, in the
following section.</p>





<h3 class="sect2title">9.2. <a name="shmat">Attach me—getting a pointer to the segment</a></h3>


<p>Before you can use a shared memory segment, you have to attach yourself
to it using the <b><tt class="func">shmat()</tt></b> call:</p>

<pre class="code">void *shmat(int <i><tt class="var em1">shmid</tt></i>, void *<i><tt class="var em1">shmaddr</tt></i>, int <i><tt class="var em1">shmflg</tt></i>);</pre>


<p>What does it all mean?  Well, <i><tt class="var">shmid</tt></i> is the shared
memory ID you got from the call to <b><tt class="func">shmget()</tt></b>.  Next is
<i><tt class="var">shmaddr</tt></i>, which you can use to tell <b><tt class="func">shmat()</tt></b>
which specific address to use but you should just set it to
<tt class="const">0</tt> and let the OS choose the address for you.  Finally,
the <i><tt class="var">shmflg</tt></i> can be set to <tt class="const">SHM_RDONLY</tt> if you
only want to read from it, <tt class="const">0</tt> otherwise.</p>

<p>Here's a more complete example of how to get a pointer to a shared
memory segment:</p>

<pre class="code">key_t key;
int shmid;
char *data;

key = ftok("/home/beej/somefile3", 'R');
shmid = shmget(key, 1024, 0644 | IPC_CREAT);
data = shmat(shmid, (void *)0, 0);</pre>


<p>And <i>bammo</i>!  You have the pointer to the shared memory
segment!  Notice that <b><tt class="func">shmat()</tt></b> returns a <nobr><tt class="type">void</tt></nobr>
pointer, and we're treating it, in this case, as a <nobr><tt class="type">char</tt></nobr>
pointer.  You can treat is as anything you like, depending on what kind
of data you have in there.  Pointers to arrays of structures are just as
acceptable as anything else.</p>

<p>Also, it's interesting to note that <b><tt class="func">shmat()</tt></b> returns
<tt class="const">-1</tt> on failure.  But how do you get <tt class="const">-1</tt> in a
<nobr><tt class="type">void</tt></nobr> pointer?  Just do a cast during the comparison to
check for errors:</p>

<pre class="code">data = shmat(shmid, (void *)0, 0);
if (data == (char *)(-1))
    perror("shmat");</pre>


<p>All you have to do now is change the data it points to normal
pointer-style. There are some samples in the next section.</p>





<h3 class="sect2title">9.3. <a name="shmrw">Reading and Writing</a></h3>


<p>Lets say you have the <i><tt class="var">data</tt></i> pointer from the above example.
It is a <nobr><tt class="type">char</tt></nobr> pointer, so we'll be reading and writing chars
from it.  Furthermore, for the sake of simplicity, lets say the 1K
shared memory segment contains a null-terminated string.</p>

<p>It couldn't be easier.  Since it's just a string in there, we can
print it like this:</p>

<pre class="code">printf("shared contents: %s\n", data);</pre>


<p>And we could store something in it as easily as this:</p>

<pre class="code">printf("Enter a string: ");
gets(data);</pre>


<p>Of course, like I said earlier, you can have other data in there
besides just <nobr><tt class="type">char</tt></nobr>s.  I'm just using them as an example.
I'll just make the assumption that you're familiar enough with pointers
in C that you'll be able to deal with whatever kind of data you stick in
there.</p>





<h3 class="sect2title">9.4. <a name="shmdet">Detaching from and deleting segments</a></h3>


<p>When you're done with the shared memory segment, your program should
detach itself from it using the <b><tt class="func">shmdt()</tt></b> call:</p>

<pre class="code">int shmdt(void *<i><tt class="var em1">shmaddr</tt></i>);</pre>


<p>The only argument, <i><tt class="var">shmaddr</tt></i>, is the address you got
from <b><tt class="func">shmat()</tt></b>.  The function returns <tt class="const">-1</tt> on
error, <tt class="const">0</tt> on success.</p>

<p>When you detach from the segment, it isn't destroyed.  Nor is it
removed when <i>everyone</i> detaches from it.  You have to
specifically destroy it using a call to <b><tt class="func">shmctl()</tt></b>, similar
to the control calls for the other System V IPC functions:</p>

<pre class="code">shmctl(shmid, IPC_RMID, NULL);</pre>


<p>The above call deletes the shared memory segment, assuming no one
else is attached to it.  The <b><tt class="func">shmctl()</tt></b> function does a lot
more than this, though, and it worth looking into.  (On your own, of
course, since this is only an overview!)</p>

<p>As always, you can destroy the shared memory segment from the command
line using the <b class="com">ipcrm</b> Unix command.  Also, be sure that you
don't leave any usused shared memory segments sitting around wasting
system resources.  All the System V IPC objects you own can be viewed
using the <b class="com">ipcs</b> command.</p>





<h3 class="sect2title">9.5. <a name="shmcon">Concurrency</a></h3>


<p>What are concurrency issues?  Well, since you have multiple processes
modifying the shared memory segment, it is possible that certain errors
could crop up when updates to the segment occur simultaneously.  This
<i>concurrent</i> access is almost always a problem when you have
multiple writers to a shared object.</p>

<p>The way to get around this is to use <a href="semaphores.html">Semaphores</a> to lock the shared memory segment
while a process is writing to it.  (Sometimes the lock will encompass
both a read an write to the shared memory, depending on what you're
doing.)</p>

<p>A true discussion of concurrency is beyond the scope of this paper,
and you might want to check out the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_%28computer_science%29" target="_blank">Wikipedia
article on the matter</a>.  I'll just leave it with this: if you
start getting weird inconsistencies in your shared data when you connect
two or more processes to it, you could very well have a concurrency
problem.</p>





<h3 class="sect2title">9.6. <a name="shmsam">Sample code</a></h3>


<p>Now that I've primed you on all the dangers of concurrent access to a
shared memory segment without using semaphores, I'll show you a demo
that does just that.  Since this isn't a mission-critical application,
and it's unlikely that you'll be accessing the shared data at the same
time as any other process, I'll just leave the semaphores out for the
sake of simplicity.</p>

<p>This program does one of two things: if you run it with no command
line parameters, it prints the contents of the shared memory segment.
If you give it one command line parameter, it stores that parameter in
the shared memory segment.</p>

<p>Here's the code for <a href="http://beej.us/guide/bgipc/examples/shmdemo.c" target="_blank">shmdemo.c</a>:</p>

<pre class="code">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/ipc.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/shm.h&gt;

#define SHM_SIZE 1024  /* make it a 1K shared memory segment */

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    key_t key;
    int shmid;
    char *data;
    int mode;

    if (argc &gt; 2) {
        fprintf(stderr, "usage: shmdemo [data_to_write]\n");
        exit(1);
    }

    /* make the key: */
    if ((key = ftok("shmdemo.c", 'R')) == -1) {
        perror("ftok");
        exit(1);
    }

    /* connect to (and possibly create) the segment: */
    if ((shmid = shmget(key, SHM_SIZE, 0644 | IPC_CREAT)) == -1) {
        perror("shmget");
        exit(1);
    }

    /* attach to the segment to get a pointer to it: */
    data = shmat(shmid, (void *)0, 0);
    if (data == (char *)(-1)) {
        perror("shmat");
        exit(1);
    }

    /* read or modify the segment, based on the command line: */
    if (argc == 2) {
        printf("writing to segment: \"%s\"\n", argv[1]);
        strncpy(data, argv[1], SHM_SIZE);
    } else
        printf("segment contains: \"%s\"\n", data);

    /* detach from the segment: */
    if (shmdt(data) == -1) {
        perror("shmdt");
        exit(1);
    }

    return 0;
}</pre>


<p>More commonly, a process will attach to the segment and run for a bit
while other programs are changing and reading the shared segment.  It's
neat to watch one process update the segment and see the changes appear
to other processes.  Again, for simplicity, the sample code doesn't do
that, but you can see how the data is shared between independent
processes.</p>

<p>Also, there's no code in here for removing the segment—be sure
to do that when you're done messing with it.</p>
