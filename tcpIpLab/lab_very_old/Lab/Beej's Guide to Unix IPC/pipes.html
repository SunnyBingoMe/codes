<h2 class="sect1title">4. <a name="pipes">Pipes</a></h2><hr class="mainsecthr"/>


<p>There is no form of IPC that is simpler than pipes.  Implemented on
every flavor of Unix, <b><tt class="func">pipe()</tt></b> and <b><tt class="func"><a href="fork.html">fork()</a></tt></b> make up the functionality behind the
"<b class="com">|</b>" in <nobr>"<b class="com">ls | more</b>".</nobr>  They are
marginally useful for cool things, but are a good way to learn about
basic methods of IPC.</p>

<p>Since they're so very very easy, I shant spent much time on them.
We'll just have some examples and stuff.</p>



<h3 class="sect2title">4.1. <a name="pipesclean">"These pipes are clean!"</a></h3>


<p>Wait!  Not so fast.  I might need to define a "file descriptor" at
this point.  Let me put it this way: you know about "<nobr><tt class="type">FILE*</tt></nobr>"
from <i><tt class="var">stdio.h</tt></i>, right?  You know how you have all those nice
functions like <b><tt class="func">fopen()</tt></b>, <b><tt class="func">fclose()</tt></b>,
<b><tt class="func">fwrite()</tt></b>, and so on?  Well, those  are actually high level
functions that are implemented using <i>file descriptors</i>, which
use system calls such as <b><tt class="func">open()</tt></b>, <b><tt class="func">creat()</tt></b>,
<b><tt class="func">close()</tt></b>, and <b><tt class="func">write()</tt></b>.  File descriptors are
simply <nobr><tt class="type">ints</tt></nobr> that are analogous to <nobr><tt class="type">FILE*</tt></nobr>'s in
<i><tt class="var">stdio.h</tt></i>.</p>

<p>For example, <i><tt class="var">stdin</tt></i> is file descriptor "0",
<i><tt class="var">stdout</tt></i> is "1", and <i><tt class="var">stderr</tt></i> is "2".  Likewise, any
files you open using <b><tt class="func">fopen()</tt></b> get their own file descriptor,
although this detail is hidden from you.  (This file descriptor can be
retrived from the <nobr><tt class="type">FILE*</tt></nobr> by using the <b><tt class="func">fileno()</tt></b>
macro from <i><tt class="var">stdio.h</tt></i>.)</p>

<p><b>How a pipe is organized.</b></p>
</center>


<p>Basically, a call to the <b><tt class="func">pipe()</tt></b> function returns a pair
of file descriptors.  One of these descriptors is connected to the write
end of the pipe, and the other is connected to the read end.  Anything
can be written to the pipe, and read from the other end in the order it
came in.  On many systems, pipes will fill up after you write about 10K
to them without reading anything out.</p>

<p>As a <a href="http://beej.us/guide/bgipc/examples/pipe1.c" target="_blank">useless example</a>, the
following program creates, writes to, and reads from a pipe.</p>

<pre class="code">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;errno.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

int main(void)
{
    int pfds[2];
    char buf[30];

    if (pipe(pfds) == -1) {
        perror("pipe");
        exit(1);
    }

    printf("writing to file descriptor #%d\n", pfds[1]);
    write(pfds[1], "test", 5);
    printf("reading from file descriptor #%d\n", pfds[0]);
    read(pfds[0], buf, 5);
    printf("read \"%s\"\n", buf);

    return 0;
}</pre>


<p>As you can see, <b><tt class="func">pipe()</tt></b> takes an array of two
<nobr><tt class="type">int</tt></nobr>s as an argument.  Assuming no errors, it connects two
file descriptors and returns them in the array.  The first element of
the array is the reading-end of the pipe, the second is the writing
end.</p>






<h3 class="sect2title">4.2. <a name="pipefork"><b><tt class="titlefunc">fork()</tt></b> and <b><tt class="titlefunc">pipe()</tt></b>â€”you have the
power!</a></h3>


<p>From the above example, it's pretty hard to see how these would even
be useful.  Well, since this is an IPC document, let's put a
<b><tt class="func">fork()</tt></b> in the mix and see what happens.  Pretend that you
are a top federal agent assigned to get a child process to send the word
"test" to the parent.  Not very glamorous, but no one ever said computer
science would be the X-Files, Mulder.</p>

<p>First, we'll have the parent make a pipe.  Secondly, we'll
<b><tt class="func">fork()</tt></b>.  Now, the <b><tt class="func">fork()</tt></b> man page tells us
that the child will receive a copy of all the parent's file descriptors,
and this includes a copy of the pipe's file descriptors.
<i>Alors</i>, the child will be able to send stuff to the
write-end of the pipe, and the parent will get it off the read-end.
<a href="http://beej.us/guide/bgipc/examples/pipe2.c" target="_blank">Like this</a>:</p>

<pre class="code">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;errno.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

int main(void)
{
    int pfds[2];
    char buf[30];

    pipe(pfds);

    if (!fork()) {
        printf(" CHILD: writing to the pipe\n");
        write(pfds[1], "test", 5);
        printf(" CHILD: exiting\n");
        exit(0);
    } else {
        printf("PARENT: reading from pipe\n");
        read(pfds[0], buf, 5);
        printf("PARENT: read \"%s\"\n", buf);
        wait(NULL);
    }

    return 0;
}</pre>


<p>Please note, your programs should have a lot more error checking than
mine do.  I leave it out on occasion to help keep things clear.</p>

<p>Anyway, this example is just like the previous one, except now we
<b><tt class="func">fork()</tt></b> of a new process and have it write to the pipe,
while the parent reads from it.  The resultant output will be something
similar to the following:</p>

<pre class="screen">PARENT: reading from pipe
 CHILD: writing to the pipe
 CHILD: exiting
PARENT: read "test"</pre>


<p>In this case, the parent tried to read from the pipe before the child
writes to it.  When this happens, the parent is said to
<i>block</i>, or sleep, until data arrives to be read.  It seems
that the parent tried to read, went to sleep, the child wrote and
exited, and the parent woke up and read the data.</p>

<p>Hurrah!!  You've just don't some interprocess communication!  That
was dreadfully simple, huh?  I'll bet you are still thinking that there
aren't many uses for <b><tt class="func">pipe()</tt></b> and, well, you're probably
right.  The other forms of IPC are generally more useful and are often
more exotic.</p>





<h3 class="sect2title">4.3. <a name="pipequest">The search for Pipe as we know it</a></h3>


<p>In an effort to make you think that pipes are actually reasonable
beasts, I'll give you an example of using <b><tt class="func">pipe()</tt></b> in a more
familiar situation.  The challenge: implement "<nobr><b class="com">ls | wc
-l</b></nobr>" in C.</p>

<p>This requires usage of a couple more functions you may never have
heard of: <b><tt class="func">exec()</tt></b> and <b><tt class="func">dup()</tt></b>.  The
<b><tt class="func">exec()</tt></b> family of functions replaces the currently running
process with whichever one is passed to <b><tt class="func">exec()</tt></b>.  This is
the function that we will use to run <b class="com">ls</b> and <nobr><b class="com">wc
-l</b></nobr>.  <b><tt class="func">dup()</tt></b> takes an open file descriptor and
makes a clone (a duplicate) of it.  This is how we will connect the
standard output of the <b class="com">ls</b> to the standard input of
<b class="com">wc</b>.  See, stdout of <b class="com">ls</b> flows into the pipe, and
the stdin of <b class="com">wc</b> flows in from the pipe.  The pipe fits right
there in the middle!</p>

<p>Anyway, <a href="http://beej.us/guide/bgipc/examples/pipe3.c" target="_blank">here is the code</a>:</p>

<pre class="code">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

int main(void)
{
    int pfds[2];

    pipe(pfds);

    if (!fork()) {
        close(1);       /* close normal stdout */
        dup(pfds[1]);   /* make stdout same as pfds[1] */
        close(pfds[0]); /* we don't need this */
        execlp("ls", "ls", NULL);
    } else {
        close(0);       /* close normal stdin */
        dup(pfds[0]);   /* make stdin same as pfds[0] */
        close(pfds[1]); /* we don't need this */
        execlp("wc", "wc", "-l", NULL);
    }

    return 0;
}</pre>


<p>I'm going to make another note about the
<b><tt class="func">close()</tt></b>/<b><tt class="func">dup()</tt></b> combination since it's pretty
weird.  <b><tt class="func">close(1)</tt></b> frees up file descriptor 1 (standard
output).  <b><tt class="func">dup(pfds[1])</tt></b> makes a copy of the write-end of the
pipe in the first available file descriptor, which is "1", since we just
closed that.  In this way, anything that <b class="com">ls</b> writes to
standard output (file descriptor 1) will instead go to
<i><tt class="var">pfds[1]</tt></i> (the write end of the pipe).  The <b class="com">wc</b>
section of code works the same way, except in reverse.</p>





<h3 class="sect2title">4.4. <a name="pipesum">Summary</a></h3>


<p>There aren't many of these for such a simple topic.  In fact, there
are nearly just about none.  Probably the best use for pipes is the one
you're most accustomed to: sending the standard output of one command to
the standard input of another.  For other uses, it's pretty limiting and
there are often other IPC techniques that work better.</p>
