<h2 class="sect1title">1. <a name="intro">Intro</a></h2><hr class="mainsecthr"/>


<p>Hey!  Socket programming got you down?  Is this stuff just a little
too difficult to figure out from the <b class="com">man</b> pages?  You want to
do cool Internet programming, but you don't have time to wade through a
gob of <nobr><tt class="type">struct</tt></nobr>s trying to figure out if you have to call
<b><tt class="func">bind()</tt></b> before you <b><tt class="func">connect()</tt></b>, etc., etc.</p>

<p>Well, guess what!  I've already done this nasty business, and I'm
dying to share the information with everyone!  You've come to the right
place.  This document should give the average competent C programmer the
edge s/he needs to get a grip on this networking noise.</p>

<p>And check it out: I've finally caught up with the future (just in the
nick of time, too!) and have updated the Guide for IPv6!  Enjoy!</p>






<h3 class="sect2title">1.1. <a name="audience">Audience</a></h3>


<p>This document has been written as a tutorial, not a complete
reference.  It is probably at its best when read by individuals who are
just starting out with socket programming and are looking for a
foothold.  It is certainly not the <i>complete and total</i> guide
to sockets programming, by any means.</p>

<p>Hopefully, though, it'll be just enough for those man pages to start
making sense... <tt>:-)</tt></p>








<h3 class="sect2title">1.2. <a name="platform">Platform and Compiler</a></h3>


<p>The code contained within this document was compiled on a Linux PC
using Gnu's <a name="indexId434909-2"></a><b class="com">gcc</b> compiler.  It
should, however, build on just about any platform that uses
<b class="com">gcc</b>.  Naturally, this doesn't apply if you're programming for
Windows—see the <a href="intro.html#windows">section on Windows
programming</a>, below.</p>

<h3 class="sect2title">1.4. <a name="solaris">Note for Solaris/SunOS Programmers</a></h3>


<p>When compiling for <a name="indexId434909-3"></a>Solaris or <a name="indexId434909-4"></a>SunOS, you need to specify some extra command-line switches
for linking in the proper libraries.  In order to do this, simply add
"<tt class="tt"><nobr>-lnsl</nobr> <nobr>-lsocket</nobr> <nobr>-lresolv</nobr></tt>" to the end of the compile command,
like so:</p>

<pre class="screen">$ cc -o server server.c -lnsl -lsocket -lresolv</pre>


<p>If you still get errors, you could try further adding a
"<tt class="tt">-lxnet</tt>" to the end of that command line.  I don't know what
that does, exactly, but some people seem to need it.</p>

<p>Another place that you might find problems is in the call to
<b><tt class="func">setsockopt()</tt></b>.  The prototype differs from that on my Linux
box, so instead of:</p>

<pre class="code">int yes=1;</pre>


<p>enter this:</p>

<pre class="code">char yes='1';</pre>


<p>As I don't have a Sun box, I haven't tested any of the above
information—it's just what people have told me through email.</p>








<h3 class="sect2title">1.5. <a name="windows">Note for Windows Programmers</a></h3>


<p>At this point in the guide, historically, I've done a bit of bagging
on <a name="indexId434909-5"></a>Windows, simply due to the fact that I don't like
it very much.  But I should really be fair and tell you that Windows has
a huge install base and is obviously a perfectly fine operating
system.</p>

<p>They say absence makes the heart grow fonder, and in this case, I
believe it to be true.  (Or maybe it's age.)  But what I can say is that
after a decade-plus of not using Microsoft OSes for my personal work,
I'm much happier!  As such, I can sit back and safely say, "Sure, feel
free to use Windows!"  ...Ok yes, it does make me grit my teeth to say
that.</p>

<p>So I still encourage you to try <a name="indexId434909-6"></a><a href="http://www.linux.com/" target="_blank">Linux</a>, <a href="http://www.bsd.org/" target="_blank">BSD</a>, or
some flavor of Unix, instead.</p>

<p>But people like what they like, and you Windows folk will be pleased
to know that this information is generally applicable to you guys, with
a few minor changes, if any.</p>

<p>One cool thing you can do is install <a name="indexId434909-7"></a><a href="http://www.cygwin.com/" target="_blank">Cygwin</a>, which is a collection of Unix tools
for Windows.  I've heard on the grapevine that doing so allows all these
programs to compile unmodified.</p>

<p>But some of you might want to do things the Pure Windows Way.  That's
very gutsy of you, and this is what you have to do: run out and get Unix
immediately!  No, no—I'm kidding.  I'm supposed to be
Windows-friendly(er) these days...</p>

<p>This is what you'll have to do (unless you install <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/" target="_blank">Cygwin</a>!): first, ignore pretty
much all of the system header files I mention in here.  All you need to
include is:</p>

<pre class="code"><a name="indexId434909-8"></a>#include &lt;winsock.h&gt;</pre>


<p>Wait!  You also have to make a call to <a name="indexId434909-9"></a><b><tt class="func">WSAStartup()</tt></b> before doing anything else
with the sockets library.  The code to do that looks something like
this:</p>

<pre class="code">#include &lt;winsock.h&gt;

{
    WSADATA wsaData;   // if this doesn't work
    //WSAData wsaData; // then try this instead

    // MAKEWORD(1,1) for Winsock 1.1, MAKEWORD(2,0) for Winsock 2.0:

    if (WSAStartup(MAKEWORD(1,1), &amp;wsaData) != 0) {
        fprintf(stderr, "WSAStartup failed.\n");
        exit(1);
    }</pre>


<p>You also have to tell your compiler to link in the Winsock library,
usually called <i><tt class="var">wsock32.lib</tt></i> or <i><tt class="var">winsock32.lib</tt></i>,
or <i><tt class="var">ws2_32.lib</tt></i> for Winsock 2.0.  Under VC++, this can be
done through the <tt class="tt">Project</tt> menu, under <tt class="tt">Settings...</tt>.
Click the <tt class="tt">Link</tt> tab, and look for the box titled "Object/library
modules".  Add "wsock32.lib" (or whichever lib is your preference) to
that list.</p>

<p>Or so I hear.</p>

<p>Finally, you need to call <a name="indexId434909-10"></a><b><tt class="func">WSACleanup()</tt></b> when you're all through
with the sockets library.  See your online help for details.</p>

<p>Once you do that, the rest of the examples in this tutorial should
generally apply, with a few exceptions.  For one thing, you can't use
<b><tt class="func">close()</tt></b> to close a socket—you need to use <a name="indexId434909-11"></a><b><tt class="func">closesocket()</tt></b>, instead.  Also, <a name="indexId434909-12"></a><b><tt class="func">select()</tt></b> only works with socket
descriptors, not file descriptors (like <tt class="const">0</tt> for
<tt class="tt">stdin</tt>).</p>

<p>There is also a socket class that you can use, <a name="indexId434909-13"></a><nobr><tt class="type">CSocket</tt></nobr>.  Check your compilers help pages
for more information.</p>

<p>To get more information about Winsock, read the <a name="indexId434909-14"></a><a href="http://tangentsoft.net/wskfaq/" target="_blank">Winsock FAQ</a> and go from
there.</p>

<p>Finally, I hear that Windows has no <a name="indexId434909-15"></a><b><tt class="func">fork()</tt></b> system call which is, unfortunately,
used in some of my examples.  Maybe you have to link in a POSIX library
or something to get it to work, or you can use <a name="indexId434909-16"></a><b><tt class="func">CreateProcess()</tt></b> instead.
<b><tt class="func">fork()</tt></b> takes no arguments, and <b><tt class="func">CreateProcess()</tt></b>
takes about 48 billion arguments.  If you're not up to that, the <a name="indexId434909-17"></a><b><tt class="func">CreateThread()</tt></b> is a little easier to
digest...unfortunately a discussion about multithreading is beyond the
scope of this document.  I can only talk about so much, you know!</p>








<h3 class="sect2title">1.6. <a name="emailpolicy">Email Policy</a></h3>


<p>I'm generally available to help out with <a name="indexId434909-18"></a>email questions so feel free to write in, but I can't guarantee a
response.  I lead a pretty busy life and there are times when I just
can't answer a question you have.  When that's the case, I usually just
delete the message.  It's nothing personal; I just won't ever have the
time to give the detailed answer you require.</p>

<p>As a rule, the more complex the question, the less likely I am to
respond.  If you can narrow down your question before mailing it and be
sure to include any pertinent information (like platform, compiler,
error messages you're getting, and anything else you think might help me
troubleshoot), you're much more likely to get a response.  For more
pointers, read ESR's document, <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html" target="_blank">How To Ask
Questions The Smart Way</a>.</p>

<p>If you don't get a response, hack on it some more, try to find the
answer, and if it's still elusive, then write me again with the
information you've found and hopefully it will be enough for me to help
out.</p>

<p>Now that I've badgered you about how to write and not write me, I'd
just like to let you know that I <i>fully</i> appreciate all the
praise the guide has received over the years.  It's a real morale boost,
and it gladdens me to hear that it is being used for good! <tt>:-)</tt>
Thank you!</p>
